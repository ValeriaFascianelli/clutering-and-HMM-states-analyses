# stress_susceptibility

Functions to fit HMM model on neuronal data and to run the clustering of inferred states. Note that the HMM is based on the model developed by Linderman Lab https://github.com/lindermanlab.

The file 'main_functions.py' contains the primary functions to fit the HMM, run clustering on the inferred hidden states, assess the participation ratio, and the Mahalanobis decoder class. 

To run the HMM and clustering analyses using the functions defined in the 'main_functions.py' file, you can use the 'main_HMM_clustering' file.
